BLOCKED: jq is not installed.

Why: This hook requires jq to parse tool input JSON. Without it, commands cannot be validated.

What to do:
  Claude Code: Ask the user to install jq.
  User: Install jq (e.g., brew install jq on macOS, sudo apt-get install jq on Linux).

Why: The hook received invalid JSON input and cannot validate the command.

What to do:
  Claude Code: Report this error to the user — it may indicate a Claude Code bug or misconfigured hook.

Command: $BLOCKED_SEGMENT

Why:
  This command is within a shared allowed prefix, but its precise form is not
  approved by the global or project regex rules.

What to do:
  Claude Code: Try a different approach, or ask the user whether this command should be allowed.
  User: Add an anchored POSIX extended regex to
        <git-root>/.agents/hooks/rules/allowed_commands.json.
