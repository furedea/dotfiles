if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  cat >&2 <<ERRMSG
BLOCKED: jq is not installed.

Why: This hook requires jq to parse tool input JSON and generated command permission rules.

What to do:
  Claude Code: Ask the user to install jq.
  User: Install jq through the declarative environment.

BLOCKED: command permissions were not found or are invalid.

Rules: $COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_FILE

Why:
  This hook blocks destructive shell commands using Nix-generated rules.

What to do:
  Claude Code: Ask the user to run the Nix switch so generated agent files are refreshed.

  This hook cannot safely evaluate fine-grained forbidden command forms.
